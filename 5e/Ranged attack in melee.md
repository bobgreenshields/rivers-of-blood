Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't [[incapacitated]].

If you are making an attack, especially a ranged attack or one with a Reach weapon, and you're shooting/reaching past a creature/object/foliage/whatever, your target **may** have half, 3/4, or total cover against your attack.

| Cover | Effect |
|:---:|:---:|
| Half | +2 AC |
| 3/4 | +5 AC |
| Total | No attack |
