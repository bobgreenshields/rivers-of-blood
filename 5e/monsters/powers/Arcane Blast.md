Arcane Blast (Recharge 5–6). 

The initiate creates an explosion of magical force in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the center of the area. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
