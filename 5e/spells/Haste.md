Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's **speed is doubled**, it gains a **+2 bonus to AC**, it has **advantage on Dexterity saving throws**, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the **Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object** action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
