As an action, you can spread a bag of fire caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area takes 3d6 fire damage or take half damage if they succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.  They stop moving this turn.  Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. 

A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.

The flames affect anyone entering the square for 3 rounds.
