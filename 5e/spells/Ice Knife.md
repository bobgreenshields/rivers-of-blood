You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **1d10 piercing** damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature **within 5 feet** of it must succeed on a **Dexterity saving throw** or take **2d6 cold** damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

M - a drop of water or a piece of ice
