## Lightly obscured

An area such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Heavily obscured

An heavily obscured area such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage, blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the [[blinded]] condition when trying to see something in that area.

## Illumination

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

### Bright light

Lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

### Dim light

Also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

### Darkness

Creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.
