([[Recharge]] 5–6). 
Or take 2 rounds to cast with charge up in the first round showing the the centre of the sphere.

The initiate creates an explosion of magical force in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a *DC 13 Dex* saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes (10) *3d6 force* damage and is *pushed 10 feet* away from the center of the area. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

### Charge up ideas
 - in the 1st round caster uses a bonus action to charge up
 - target location starts glowing
 - requires concentration between rounds
