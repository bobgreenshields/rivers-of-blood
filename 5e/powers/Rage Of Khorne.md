The target must make a Cha save or begin to [[Reckless Attack]].  Advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength, but attack rolls against you have advantage.  Raging cultists never need to take morale checks.

Willing targets can choose to fail their save and unwilling targets get to end the effect by making a Cha save on any of their turns.
