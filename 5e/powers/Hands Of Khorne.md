Bloody , clawed hands reach out from the ground in a 20ft square and grab at any creature in the area.  The region becomes difficult terrrain and anyone entering or starting their turn in the area must make a Dex save or take 2d4 Necrotic damage and be restrained.  Anyone restrained can use their action to make a Dex or Str save to free themselves.  If already restrained you automatically take the damage at the start of your turn.
