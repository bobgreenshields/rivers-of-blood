The target's (usually self) arms change into four 10ft long tentacles with jagged bony ends.  The caster gains the Multiattack 2 attacks (can be different targets) with a 10 ft reach.  The tentacles hit for 1d8 bludgeoning and the caster can use their reaction to make an opportunity attack when anyone enters their reach.
