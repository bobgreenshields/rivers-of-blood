When someone comes within 10ft of the caster the caster can use a reaction to project a jet of blood from their mouth onto the target.

The blood is mobile and semi-sentient making it's way onto the face and eyes and imposing a minus to attack rolls.

| Round | Att. modifier |

| 1 | -2 |
| 2 | -4 |
| 3 | -2 |

The blood loses its animation after 3 rounds and drops off.
