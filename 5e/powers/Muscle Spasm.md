The target must make a Con save or suffer uncontrollable twitching for 3 rounds.

Attacks are at -3 whilst under the influence of the is spell and a DC 15 Dex save needs to be made in order to successfully cast spells with a Somantic component.  The spell slot is wasted on a failed save.

*Variant*
Roll a d4 each round and this is subtracted from your attack roll or added to 12 to determine the DC of the Dex save to cast a spell.  When you roll a 1 this is the last round that the spell takes effect.
