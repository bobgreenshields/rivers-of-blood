You create a 10-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

Anyone moving into or starting their turn in the cloud takes 1d6 Acid damage.
