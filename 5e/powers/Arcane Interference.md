Creates a barrier that interferes with spells.  For each spell passing through the barrier roll a d8 and the result is the number of 10%s that the effectiveness of the spell is reduced by e.g. roll a 4 the effectiveness of the spell is 100 - 4 * 10 = 60%

If a one is rolled the barrier drops **after** the 10% reduction.
