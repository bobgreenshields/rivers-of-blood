Usually a [[Recharge]] power.

A fiery fist sized globe of blood hits the target for 2d4 (or more) fire damage.  Auto-hit, no save, no attack roll needed just like [[Magic Missile]].

### Variant
Like [[Magic Missile]] the caster could conjure multiple fiery blood globes each attacking a different target for 1d4 fire damage.

Or use fewer globes at 1d6 damage each so it seems less like [[Magic Missile]].
