When the creature uses its action to Dash, it can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If it moves at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, it either gains a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll (if it chooses to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from it (if it chose to shove and it succeeded).
