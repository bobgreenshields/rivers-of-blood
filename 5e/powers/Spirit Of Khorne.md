### Description

Cast on a willing target who becomes possessed by a demonic spirit of Khorne.

The target begins to change as their skin peels back, their teeth become fangs and their fingers claws.

They fight with savage intensity adding multiattack 2 to their stats and the weapon they hold is shrouded in hellfire for an additional 1d6 fire damage.  The demonic energy keeps them in the battle giving 20 temporary HP.

The Spirit is an anathema to the material world.  All hostile combatants within 30 ft must make a DC 15 Char save on the start of their turn or
- use a move action to close with the possessed
- make a melee attack on the possessed using lethal damage

The save can be re-attempted at the start of each of their turns, if made
- they can move out of the radius but
- have disadvantage when attacking a target other than the possessed whilst within the aggro radius

If the possessed body is killed the spirit will look for another willing host within 60ft taking one round to possess it (during which the host can act as normal) showing the initial symptoms of the possession.
