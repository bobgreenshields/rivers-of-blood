Owner [[Teldorthans Arms]], the town's weaponsmith and armorer.

He is a garrulous old Dwarf who spends his time trading stories with his customers with a pipe clenched in his teeth, while his apprentices (two of whom are his sons) do the work.  Make no mistakeâ€”Teldorthan is a master armorer, and under his supervision his apprentices turn out work of exceptional quality.
