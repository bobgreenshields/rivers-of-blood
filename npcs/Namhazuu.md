An ageing, alchoholic [[Minotaur]].  Whilst way beyond his prime and mostly washed up he is still quite a brute and a very effective bodyguard for [[The Cudgel]].  The years may have taken away some of his strength but they have replaced it with guile and cunning.

- Prone to mood swings
- Not chatty
- Whilst often surly
- He can be found in a reflexive mood during the early stages of drinking
- He is very fond of [[Yindrevi Ruvravrivzu]]
- and has made it known that he will protect her
- cunning and brutal 

His years as an underworld enforcer have given him the Tavern Brawler feat (this gives Namhazuu 2d4+4 damage on an unarmed strike) and proficiency in Stealth +5
