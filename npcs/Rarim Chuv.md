Old friend of [[Malachi Klendathu]] and agent of the [[Faren Markelhay|Lord Warden]].

- investigating a break in at [[Moonstone Keep]]
	- no one will say what is missing
- came across a small shard of warpstone

- going to meet a contact at the [[Warmheart Waystation | waystation]] to find out more
- the cult were following him and disappeared [[Malachi Klendathu|Malachi]]

### Last words
- has a splinter of warpstone held in his hand (or on his body)
- it looks abandoned but it's not
- under the alc
- more widespread than I thought (ish)


### Warpstone
- will tingle and glow near to the abandoned warehouse
