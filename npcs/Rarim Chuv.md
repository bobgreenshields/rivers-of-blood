Old friend of Suzi's mentor and agent of the Lord Warden.

- investigating the movement against the warden
- came across a small shard of warpstone
- took it to mentor for identification
- going to meet a contact at the [[Warmheart Waystation | waystation]] to find out more
- the cult were following him and disappeared the mentor

### Last words
- has a splinter of warpstone held in his hand (or on his body)
- it looks abandoned but it's not
- under the alc
- more widespread than I thought (ish)


### Warpstone
- will tingle and glow near to the abandoned warehouse
