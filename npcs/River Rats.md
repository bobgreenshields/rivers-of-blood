A criminal gang led by [[Calthar]], sometimes called Calthar's Cuthroats when people are confident that he won't hear.

They are blackmailing the [[Gakrern Tallore|alchemist]] to make them a large batch of [[Potion of Heroism]] for them to sell into the black market.

Unfortunately for them [[The Cudgel]] has a mole at a senior level and is aware of their activities.
