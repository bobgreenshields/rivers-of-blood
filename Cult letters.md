### Silversmith

  

That idiot FM is blundering about intrusively.  We need to distract him.  Construct an item that will entice him; he will spend days focused on it and that is all we need.

  
  

### Other

  

The Merging of Eights and the time of Vaddh’akar approaches.  Make preparations to bring the faithful by the river.  

  
  
  

[^1]: Kelestroj.  A Hobgoblin tribe.  Most humans will not know it (they can’t tell Hobgoblins apart) but a Druid will know it.

  

[^2]: Quo-Var.  Var is Dwarvish for eight.  The prefix “quo-“ is an AD cabalistic appellation meaning ‘conclusive’ or ‘zenith’.  A scribe or sage with the relevant competency will recognize it.

  

[^3]: Lakh; archaic Dwarven (AD) for a stronghold or place of safety.

  

4 Spota; old human term meaning ‘doorway’ (he means the portal)
