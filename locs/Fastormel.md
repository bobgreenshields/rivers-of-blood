Once a prosperous town on the shores of [Lake Nen](https://tahlequahpointsoflight.fandom.com/wiki/Lake_Nen "Lake Nen"), Fastormel was destroyed by the Bloodspear orcs and has never been resettled. The town was ruled by a Lord Mage (the most powerful wizard in town claimed the ruler’s scepter), and the Mistborn Tower of the last Lord Mage still stands amid the ruins of the town. The tower is shrouded in a strange silver mist that never dissipates, no matter what the weather would otherwise dictate.
