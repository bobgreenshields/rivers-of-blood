The house and workshop of [[Malerakas Xandax]], the silversmith.

There are two items being consteucted in his workshop.  A metal frame studded with small warpstones atop a stone plinth.  Looks strangely like a door frame without a door [[Portal frame]] covered by a linen sheet.

On his workbench is a small silver box with an internal lock linked to intricate levers and hidden panels on the outside of the box.

Somewhere in the house will be found
- muddy boots
	- river mud and
	- catacomb mud
- dark robes with a bright red lining
- a red stone broach in the shape of a fox's head
- a hooded lantern
