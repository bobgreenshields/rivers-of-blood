A small, well-off trading company, House Azaer is owned by the tieflings of the Azaer family. They import goods (including arms and armor) from [Hammerfast](https://rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Hammerfast "Hammerfast"), Harkenwold, and the lands to the south, and organize caravans up to [Winterhaven](https://rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Winterhaven "Winterhaven") several times a year. House Azaer is an excellent place to purchase nearly any mundane equipment from the Player’s Handbook, although its prices are a little on the high side.

[[Amara Azaer]] is in charge of the house business in Fallcrest, and spends her time on the premises.
