Dwarf artisans from the citadel of [Hammerfast](https://rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Hammerfast "Hammerfast") built a fine stone bridge over the Nentir two hundred years ago. Although the bridge was destroyed when Fallcrest fell, the great stone piers supporting it remained intact, so a few years back the people of the town laid a new timber trestle over the old stone footings.

A small toll house guards the western side of the bridge. Five Fallcrest guards under the command of [[Sergeant Thurmina]] watch this post. They collect a toll of 1 cp per head (and 1 sp per mount) making use of the bridge in either direction.  The river current begins to pick up on the south side of the bridge. Boats (or swimmers) venturing far from the banks are in danger of being carried over the falls.
