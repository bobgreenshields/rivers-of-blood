#### In the cellar

The robes found in the basement shrine are reversibel.  Dark on the outside but with a bright red lining.

### Outside

The [[River Rats]] have posted guards around the house in addition to those of the alchemist.

The alchemist always has a couple of [[Guard]] by the front door and these have been augmented by [[Calthar]].  He has hidden or disguised two [[Rogue]] in the area and has two half-elf [[Rogue | rogue archers]] with darkvision in overwatch atop nearby roofs.  There is also a middle aged female [[River Rat Wizard | low level caster ]] sitting with an old lady in the front room of one of the nearby houses.

There are a couple of lanterns hanging on the outside of the house that provide illumination during night time and one of the [[Guard]] will make regular patrols around the house.

If there is significant noise [[Zlatan]] will hear and will first warn his master and then come outside to help.

### Tactics
The [[Guard]] will be outside the house.

The [[Rogue]] on the roof tops will keep watch and have a bag of pebbles for attracting attention of the guards.  They are well hidden (adv on Stealth) and even when attacking will have half cover from the roof tops.

The [[Rogue]] on the ground will stay hidden until an opportunity presents itself.

The [[Rogue]] will attack any target that is prone from either the [[Guard]] trip attack or the [[River Rat Wizard | wizards]] [[Hideous Laughter]] spell.  They will disengage and move away whenever possible.

The [[Rogue]] will attack any squishy casters if there are no prime targets and they do not have to move too far away from the melee.
