### Outside

The [[River Rats]] have posted guards around the house in addition to those of the alchemist.

The alchemist always has a couple of heavies by the front door and these have been augmented by [[Calthar]].  He has hidden or disguised two rogues in the area and has two archers atop nearby roofs.  There is also a low level caster placed in the front room of one of the nearby houses.
