When Fallcrest was a larger city, it supported several good-sized temples located in the Hightown districts. With the town’s depopulation, several of these were abandoned, including the House of the Sun, a temple dedicated to Pelor. The place also includes shrines to Kord and Bahamut. Recently, a zealous dwarf priest of Pelor named [[Grundelmar]] came to Fallcrest from [Hammerfast](https://rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Hammerfast "Hammerfast") and reestablished this old temple.
