Fallcrest’s southern gate was destroyed in the attack that devastated the city long ago, and it still has not been entirely rebuilt. One of the two paired towers is nothing but rubble, and several large gaps remain in the town walls south of the bluffs through which anyone could enter the city.

Despite its lack of functionality, the King’s Gate is still used as a guardpost by the Fallcrest guards. [[Sergeant Greruga]] is in charge here; he is a tall, lanky man who doesn’t say much, answering questions with a grunt or a shake of the head.
