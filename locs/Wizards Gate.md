Fallcrest’s eastern city gate is known as Wizard’s Gate, because it’s the gate most convenient to the [[Septarchs Tower]]. The road to the east travels a few miles into the surrounding hills, linking a number of outlying farms and homesteads with the town.

The gate resembles Knight’s Gate in construction, and is similarly watched by a detachment of five guards and a sergeant. The leader of this detachment is [[Sergeant Murgeddin]]. A friendly drink goes a long way toward loosening Murgeddin’s tongue about that long-ago war.
