The third of Fallcrestâ€™s temples is devoted to Sehanine. It also includes shrines to Corellon, Melora, and Avandra. The [[Faren Markelhay | Markelhays]] regard Sehanine as their special patron, and over the years they have given generously to the temple. The temple occupies a commanding position atop the bluffs, and its white minarets can be seen from any corner of Lowtown.

The leader of the temple is High Priest [[Ressilmae Starlight]].  He has limited access to the following ritual scrolls: Cure Disease (2), Raise Dead (1), Remove Affliction (1).
