A dwarven hold cut from the rock of a deep vale in the Dawnforge Mountains, Hammerfast is the largest and wealthiest town in the region. It is also the most haunted. The Trade Road runs through the citadel gates and continues eastward beyond the Dawnforge Mountains. Hammerfast is governed by a council of masters, each the leaders of one of the town’s powerful guilds. The current High Master is the leader of the merchant guild, a dwarf named Marsinda Goldspinner. The inhabitants of Hammerfast look to their own first and don’t give away anything for free, but they are honest and industrious.

## History

The current city of Hammerfast is the third such "city" to stand on the site. The first was a Dwarven necropolis. As the nearby Dwarven colonies grew rich and prosperous, so to did the tombs and businesses catering to the dead interred there. So rich, that it drew raiding parties and eventually a Orcish horde. The orcs slaughtered the living dwarves and set about plundering and despoiling the tombs of the dwarves. Eventually, the easily plundered treasures and loot were played out, and the remaining tomb complex traps and now vengeful undead outweighed reward of the remaining treasure. The orcs traveled on, leaving the necropolis a ruin. With the fall of Nerath, and the subsequent fall of the Dwarven colonies to famine, plague, and roving monsters caused the local Dwarven communities to make a fateful choice. "Why waste fortifications on the dead?" And thus, the ruins of the Necropolis of Hammerfast became the living city of Hammerfast. A strange (and epic!) tale tells of the negotiations between the dwarven clans and the orcish warbands, and the clerics and shamans of Moradin and Gruumsh hammering out their arrangement.

Today, Hammerfast is a thriving trade town with stark reminders of it's past. The remaining sealed tombs stand untouched on pain of death by decree of the Town Council. The ghosts of orcs and dwarves still walk the streets, some of them orc warriors slain in the Bloodspears' attack, others priests of Moradin or the necropolis's doomed guardians, and even a few of them dwarves laid to rest here long ago. Such creatures enjoy full citizenship in Hammerfast, as long as they observe its laws. In a sacred compact struck with Moradin and Gruumsh, the town's founders agreed to respect the dead and defend their resting places in return for the right to settle here.
