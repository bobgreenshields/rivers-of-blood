This is the home of the self-styled “lord” [Armos Amroth](https://rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Armos_Amroth "Armos Amroth"), a wealthy landowner who collects rents from scores of farmers and herders living in the countryside nearby. Armos is a brusque, balding man of about fifty who makes a show of loaning money in good faith and exacting only what the law allows—but somehow he has quietly bought up dozens of free farms over the years and turned their owners into his tenants.
