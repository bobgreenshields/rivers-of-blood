This small keep stands at the southern end of the Old Hills. Once it was the seat of a small manor, but it fell into ruin long ago. It has now been taken over by a group of bandits in secret league with Barton of [Fiveleague House](https://tahlequahpointsoflight.fandom.com/wiki/Fiveleague_House "Fiveleague House"). The group is led by a trio of Shadar-Kai named Ezroun, Samminel, and Geriesh.
