Hidden away in the depths of the catacombs is the portal to [[Hadley's Haven]].

### Approach

- a path leads along a step in the cliff
- talking and joking can be heard from further along
- 3 men of the Town Guard are at the entrance
- preventing any unauthorised entry
- by the order of [[Sergeant Greruga]]
- who is restricting access due to rumours of strange creatures within, and 
- the disappearance of townsfolk

### On entering

- an ornate stone facade on the side of the cliff
- leads through to a medium sized cave
	- made more regular by carving and regions of old, crumbling bricks
	- torches are stacked in several places
	- dead bunches of flowers on the floor
	- and in small pots in wall alcoves
- a passage leads off into the cliff
	- the floor is dusty but
	- with some mud recently trodden through
	- the ceiling is supported by ad hoc pillars
- all along the walls are alcoves almost like shelves
	- some carved, some made with bricks
	- others a combination of both
	- in each alcove lies a body wrapped in rags
	- the are of varying age and states of decay
	- sometimes new bodies have been lain upon much older now decayed ones
- numerous passages lead of the main one
	- some short, others leading off into the darkness
	- several are quite broad but most are narrow [[catacombs2-cr.jpg]]
	 - occasionally they terminate in large metal doors often with a crest on them

### Going deeper

- the mud gives way to foot prints in the dust
- which turn into a large side passage
- growing sense of unease
- at first it feels like imagination but a scratching/scraping sound can be faintly heard
	- usually from behind
	- if the party turns and follows the sound
	- it recedes and dissipates
- torches flicker and their light seems dim
- shadows creep towards the light
- and are unnaturally deep
- confusing symbols have been daubed on the walls
- in a flaky dark brown liquid (blood)
- clerics and those with high religion realise that this part of the catacombs have been desecrated

Light sucking gloom at the end of the corridor.
