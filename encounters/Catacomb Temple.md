Hidden away in the depths of the catacombs is the cult's temple.

They have an arrangement with a ghoul who resides in the caves.  The cult feeds the bloodless corpses to the ghoul and in (or two?) return it scares away anyone curious about the catacombs.  The ghoul lets the cultists come and go.

- is there a [[Heart Crab swarm]] guarding the temple?
- home to the [[Blood Demon]]?
- do we use Skaven here
- or Darklings perhaps
- possibly even a few Deugar
- or none of the above, just cultists
