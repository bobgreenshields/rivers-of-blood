Really simple encounter with a homeless child on the street

> [!Question]- How do you feel about Tieflings?
> - I've not been sure about them but I'm ready to give it a try.  The urchin could be a Tiefling but not if there is one in the party.

### Events
- urchin approaches pcs to help (for money of course)
	- a place to stay
	- the best traders to buy from
	- the taverns with the best beer
	- who to avoid
	- etc
- suddenly zooms off to snatch up a loaf of bread thats fallen off the back a cart
- after a cry of "Stop thief"
- someone (town guard?) grabs the kid
- and the baker comes back 
- ready to give the kid a beating
- if the party steps up for the kid
- the guard tells them to go to the [[Temple of Tyr]] for judgement
- [[Deacon Dasqusti]] is there
- resistution could be paid but the kid has no money
- the party can offer to pay
	- it's 10 sp to the baker (that's a lot for a loaf of bread)
	- and a 10sp donation to Tyr
- if not the kid loses a hand - is that too brutal?
- [[Bishop Taryamre]] then appears and approves of [[Deacon Dasqusti]]'s judgement

### Achieves
- gain an ally to provide information
- introduces npcs
	- town guard who works for [[Sergeant Greruga]]
	- [[Bishop Taryamre]]
	- [[Deacon Dasqusti]]
- [[Temple of Tyr]] is full of custom made silver items (scales etc)
