The pcs arrive at the location to find it overrun with Hobgoblins(?)

### Hooks

Suzi was lodging with an old sage [[Malachi Klendathu]] who served as a kind of mentor.  Not into arcane arts but [[Malachi Klendathu|Malachi]] tutored Suzi on how to study and generally looked out for her.  They got on really well and would stay up until the small hours talking philosophy and musing about the nature of the universe.

[[Malachi Klendathu|Malachi]] gets visited by his old friend [[Rarim Chuv]] who tells him that he has been investigating a break in at the [[Moonstone Keep]].  The problem is that no one seems to know what was taken, or, if his suspicions are correct, no one wants to admit to what was stolen.  The break in centred on the library and  since [[Malachi Klendathu|Malachi]] has spent many days there studying [[Rarim Chuv|Rarim]] wondered if he might have any theories as to what might have gone missing.

[[Rarim Chuv|Rarim]] also asks [[Malachi Klendathu|Malachi]] if he can identify a small glowing gem fragment that has come into his possession.  Discussion between the two friends became hushed and tense at this point and the details could not be heard.  [[Rarim Chuv|Rarim]] finished by saying that he would be travelling incognito to the [[Warmheart Waystation]] to meet a contact who might know the source of the gemstone.

Ione was in this location on her way to checking out the disturbance in the forest.



Bryn is thinking of being this kind of paladin

**_The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels._**
