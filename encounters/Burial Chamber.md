The chamber contains the remains of an important [[Fallcrest]] family (choose name) and along with the bodies useful magic items and treasures were entombed.

The tomb is maintained by 3 (or 4) constructs that tidy and repair.  They also serve as a second line of defense.  The primary defense is made up of a dozen [[Tensor beasts]].

These function more like an environmental hazard.

Each round any party member will be attacked on a 1-3 of a d6 unless they are looting a coffin in which case it is 1-3 on a d4 (or maybe not have the increase?).

Maybe also increase attack chance for targets that have been grappled by the constructs and so are [[restrained]] giving advantage to the [[Tensor beasts]] attacks.
