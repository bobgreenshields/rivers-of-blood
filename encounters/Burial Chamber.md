The chamber contains the remains of an important [[Fallcrest]] family (choose name) and along with the bodies useful magic items and treasures were entombed.

The tomb is maintained by 3 (or 4) [[Clockwork Warden | constructs]] that tidy and repair.  They also serve as a second line of defense.  The primary defense is made up of a dozen [[Tensor beasts]].

These function more like an environmental hazard.

Each round any party member will be attacked on a 1-3 of a d6 unless they are looting a coffin in which case it is 1-3 on a d4 (or maybe not have the increase?).

Maybe also increase attack chance for targets that have been grappled by the [[Clockwork Warden | constructs]] and so are [[restrained]] giving advantage to the [[Tensor beasts]].

### Approach
- A turning off of the sewer
- Investigation check to notice the architecture and stonework is similar to that at the opening of the catacombs
- There is a heavy iron gate
	- obviously old and rusted
	- but still robust
	- investigation check reveals the it has been damaged *and repaired* before
	- can be lock picked (hard DC)
	- or forced (Str check to do it reasonably quietly or quickly)
- Corridors have neat piles of armour and bones
	- armour and bones tidily seperated
	- investigation check shows that many of the bones have deep cuts in them
