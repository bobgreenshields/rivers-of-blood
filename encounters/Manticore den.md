There have been numerous reports of a manticore raiding farms and travellers on the road in search of tasty man flesh.  Few know of the location of the lair apart from [[Wilda Warmheart]].  She has collated the locations of the attacks and then sent scouts out to look for possible lairs and any trace of the beast.

What nobody knows is that there are two manitcores, **Kinziru and Hammurabi**.

- they've taken a cult messenger who still had the letter on his person
- and it's now within a pile of remains in the manticore's cave
- they have some good treasure items left over after they ate their prey

The lair is in an old ruin of a temple.  Long abandoned, the temple is at the top of a hill.  One edge of the hill is a sheer crag, the other a grassy slope.  An old stepped path makes its way up the hillside before curving around to the grassy slope.  

Two thirds of the way up the crag is a cave opening that has been adorned by ornate pillars on either side.  The cave sides were worked and the floor paved to create the main hall of the temple, open on one side to face the setting sun.

The trail leads to the main entrance to the temple.  A couple of caves have been fashioned into antechambers and these lead to a stair case up to the main hall.  The doors at the top of the stairs have been blocked up by the manticores to prevent the ingress of Stirges who have made a large nest high in the natural rooves of the antechamber caves.  The doors can be forecd by making only a moderate Strength check.

Halfway up the trail a tracking (Survival) check will reveal an old fork in the path.  Although faint the alternative trail wends its way through the base of the rocky crag to a large rockfall.  Following this trail will minimise the amount of climbing needed.

Be aware of how much noise the party make climbing up, this will alert [[Kinziru]].  Climbing checks will need to be made.  On a fail of 5 or move they may take a small fall (1d6 damage) otherwise they just trigger a (noisy) rockfall.

Noise from climbers will alert [[Kinziru]] who will fly out and attack using his tail spikes.

[[Hammurabi]] is out hunting but will return as the 1d4 doom timer.
