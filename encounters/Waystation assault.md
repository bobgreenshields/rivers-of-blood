- The location where [[Rarim Chuv]] was meeting his contact
- Only a day or so from [[Hadley's Haven]]
- A fortifed inn on either of the main roads
- Attacked by a large force of goblinoids
	- for 3rd lvl make it Hobgoblins leading goblins
- Do they kill the contact?
- Or are they cover for an assassination?

#### Encounter play ideas
- The faster they get to the contact the more chance the contact is alive
- Actually a series of encounters
	- helping some of the guards and Wilda's niece fight off a big group
		- cornered by goblinoids atop the wall
	- saving the contact
- [[Wilda Warmheart]] wants to persue the attackers
	- to stop them raiding any other farmsteads
	- rescue any prisoners
	- she sends out a  couple of scouts almost right away to tail the Goblins
	- but it's total termination with extreme prejudice
	- the party get a particular task close off one avenue of escape
		- party get to choose ambush positions
		- in some old ruins in a rocky defile
		- but they are surprised that there are prisoners in the ruins
		- and the goblins are going to execute them before they leave camp
	- mixed in amongst the escaping goblins and hobgoblins are 2 ogres
	- one of the prisoners has the location of the manticore den
		- his son led an expedition to clear them out
		- spoke to survivors and triangulated from the direction the manticore left the attack
		- using the information from several attacks they pinpointed the den
		- he didn't come back from the mission
		- so the old man went out to find him and got captured by the goblins
	- some of the prisoners may give clues about who is paying for the slaves
	- [[Wilda Warmheart | Wilda]] offers them the loot in the camp
	- is this where they get the salt wagon?
