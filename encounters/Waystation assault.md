- The location where Suzi's master was meeting his contact
- Only a day or so from [[Hadley's Hollow]]
- A fortifed inn on either of the main roads
- Attacked by a large force of goblinoids
	- for 3rd lvl make it Hobgoblins leading goblins
- Do they kill the contact?
- Or are they cover for an assassination?

#### Encounter play ideas
- The faster they get to the contact the more chance the contact is alive
- Actually a series of encounters
	- helping some of the guards fight off a big group
		- cornered by goblinoids atop the wall
	- rescuing a family from the attackers
	- closing the gates
	- putting out fires *lame*
	- saving the contact
- [[Wilda Warmheart]] wants to persue the attackers
	- to stop them raiding any other farmsteads
	- rescue any prisoners
	- she sends out a  couple of scouts almost right away to tail the Goblins
	- but it's total termination with extreme prejudice
	- the party get a particular task
		- protect prisoners
		- close off one avenue of escape
	- some of the prisoners may give clues about who is paying for the slaves
	- [[Wilda Warmheart | Wilda]] offers them the loot in the camp
	- is this where they get the salt wagon
- Do they get more info from contact by braving the battle for longer?
