- The location where Suzi's master was meeting his contact
- Only a day or so from [[Hadley's Hollow]]
- A fortifed inn on either of the main roads
- Attacked by a large force of goblinoids
- Do they kill the contact?
- Or are they cover for an assassination?

#### Encounter play ideas
- The faster they get to the contact the more chance the contact is alive
- Do they get more info from contact by braving the battle for longer?
