### Cast
- [[Malerakas Xandax]] Cult High Priest
- 3 Mercenaries [[Guard]] (Guard2 in monster cards)
- 3 Dwarven Mercs 22ish HP AC 14 Spears Co-ord attack (see Hobgob warrior)
- 3 archers [[#Low lvl rogue]]
- 4 diggers with shovels and torches
- one master earthworker with [[Mold Earth]] cantrip

### Loot
#### Malerakas

#### Guards (each)
- [[Potion of Greater Healing]]
- `dice: 3d6 +50`  gp
- `dice: 5d6`  sp
- one has a  50gp gem in his boot `dice: [[Loot tables#^50gp-gemstones]]`

### The plan

- the archers hide behind trees to the rear
- DC17 Stealth and 3/4 (or 1/2?)  cover
- guards spread to the front
- [[Malerakas Xandax|Malerakas]] with the earth workers
- they have excavated the earth into a mound
- 2 workers and the master are standing holding torches
- 2 workers are digging around in the loose soil for Crimson Tide
- in 1d4 rounds they will find the sword and give it to [[Malerakas Xandax|Malerakas]]
- he will be overcome by excitement and  bloodlust and will want to try out the sword on a lightly armoured member of the party

### On action

- [[Malerakas Xandax|Malerakas]] already has [[Mage Armour]] cast
- the Mercs will spin their poleaxes (with visible skill)
- and ask
> Do you really want to do this?
- he will cast Hands of Khorne if the PCs are grouped
- archers have hidden (Stealth +7)
- getting advantage on anyone who hasn't seen them
- archers will target anyone [[restrained]]
- if none [[restrained]] will target the lightest armoured
- after shooting they will duck back move rehide (cunning action)
- to gain advantage again
- should we give them Sneak Attack for an extra 1d6 if hidden???
- [[Malerakas Xandax|Malerakas]] shouts at the diggers
> Keep digging!  20 gold to whoever finds it!
- if approached the Mercs will make a show of their skill with poleaxes
-  [[Malerakas Xandax|Malerakas]] will hit the back row with Blood of Khorne


#### Low lvl rogue

- short bows +5 1d6+3
- stealth +7
- sneak attack +1d6 ??? not sure
- cunning action, dash, disengage or hide as bonus action
