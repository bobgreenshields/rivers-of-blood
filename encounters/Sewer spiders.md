- DC 12 Invest spider body warpstone splinters
- DC 15 Invest spider body scarring around splinters

### Terrain

- several streams draining towards a central water fall
- larger open area by waterfall
	- broken grill
	- dex to grab
	- repeated dex saves after 1d6 damage
- several levels
- maybe make them go over a bridge


### Spiders

- keep reaction to teleport to ranged and spell attackers
- replace restrain with a web pull but make it a bonus action
- add leg strike on adjacent target on any bite attack

The Skaven impregnated 3 baby giant spiders with warpstone splinters under the skin of their bodies.  They have now grown and the warpstone had twisted them into aggressive guardians that have the ability to move in and out of the warp.  This works just like the ethereal jaunt of the phase spider.

As the party moves along the sewer walkway web builds up on the paving and walls until the cave is encircled with web.

The spiders will be viewing from the warp when the party first arrive and will phase in to web and bite.

They are not very intelligent and so will not specifically target different types of characters with different attacks.

They will, however, move on from poisoned and restrained targets to engage others.

If the party examine the spiders they will find the warpstone splinters (DC 12 Invest) and notice the scarring around them (DC15 Invest) indicating that they were planted inside the spiders.
