Maybe throw in a [[Gelatinous Cube]] to maximise the fun ðŸ˜œ

Check out the dpr calcs spreadsheet.

They drop off after 10HP of damage and this seems to be in 3 or less rounds regardless of AC.  Round 1 dpr is about 3 so 3 [[Stirge]]s will inflict about 9 HP on the first round.

At average of 2HP and AC14 they will die fast but not until they have inflicted some damage.

### Spawn

| Round | Roll | Range | Average |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 4d4 / 2 | 2-8 | 5 |
| 2+ | 3d4 / 2 | 2-6 | 4 |

The pcs roll a d6 each and the 2 lowest get attacked by half the spawn each, if it's more than 3 the overflow goes to the next lowest roll.
