A demonic animate pool of blood.

It can use a ranged psychic attack which can possibly stun and adversary.

It can enter a stunned person through an orifice (usually mouth) and then control that being.  Watching this happen requires a save or the creature is incapacitated by the sheer horror.

The Blood Demon can be used a plot device by possessing  npcs and getting them to do really evil things that are totally out of character.

Some inspiration might be taken from some of the mechanics for the intellect devourer.

-   **Mindsense**. The intellect devourer is aware of the presence of creatures within 300 feet of it that have an [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) of 3 or higher. It knows the relative distance and direction of each creature, regardless of physical barriers. Creatures under the effects of magic that protects the mind cannot be detected by the intellect devourer.
-   **Consume Mind**. The intellect devourer chooses one creature it can see within 30 feet of it that has an [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) of 3 or higher. The target must succeed on a DC 13 [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) saving throw or take 16 (3d10) psychic damage. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) score is reduced to 0. The target is incapacitated until it regains at least 1 point of [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) (either from completing a [long rest](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/the-environment/#Long_Rest) or from a [lesser restoration](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/lesser-restoration) spell).
-   **Body Snatcher**. The intellect devourer chooses one incapacitated creature within 5 feet of it and engages it in a contest of [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence). The intellect devourer overpowers the creature’s mental defenses if it beats the target on a contested [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) check. The intellect devourer magically consumes the creature’s brain and teleports into its skull, taking full control of the target’s body. While inside the creature’s skull, the intellect devourer has total [cover](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover) against attacks and other effects outside of the host. The intellect devourer retains its [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence), [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom), and [Charisma](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Charisma) scores, as well as its comprehension of language, its telepathy, and its traits. Otherwise, it inherits the target’s statistics, memories and knowledge, including spells and languages. If the host body drops to [0 hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dropping-to-0-Hit-Points), the intellect devourer must leave the host. It can also be magically forced from the host’s body by means of a [protection from evil and good](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/protection-from-evil-and-good) spell being cast on the host. If the host’s devoured brain is restored (only possibly with a [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell), the intellect devourer is forced out of the host. The intellect devourer can choose to leave the host at any time by spending 5 feet of its movement and then teleporting to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the target. Unless its brain is restored within 1 round, the body dies.
