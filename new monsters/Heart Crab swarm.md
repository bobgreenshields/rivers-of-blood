When the heart of a human sacrifice to Khorne is torn out, the Blood God imbues it with a twisted form of life to become a guardian of the temple or shrine.

The heart grows legs, eyes on stalks, teeth and several tentacle like probocises (very much like The Thing).

The heart crabs swarm into groups of 12-15 scuttling around in the shadows that surround the shrine.  They will attack any interlopers who are not there to worship Khorne.

The swarms are not intelligent per se but possess a demonic cunning prefering to follow their victims and wait until they are occupied with something else (especially combat).

On a successful attack 1d4 hearts will climb over their adversary and tear at them with their teeth for 2 pts of damage each.  They will then insert their proboscis and the heart will begin to pump blood out of their victim through the open aorta and arteries onto the ground causing 2pts of damage per heart every round after the initial attack.

A heart crab swarm will generally continue to attack until there are a maximum of 5 hearts attached to a medium sized creature.

Hearts are not difficult to tear off requiring only a DC8 Strength check but due to their slippery nature an action needs to be taken to detach each one.
