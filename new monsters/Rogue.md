#### Sneak Attack
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t [[incapacitated]] and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

#### Cunning Action

You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage or Hide action.

#### Skirmisher

You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Steady Aim

As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

## Higher CR
#### Skulker
Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher

You are an expert at slinking through shadows. You gain the following benefits:
-   You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.
-   When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged weapon attack, making the attack doesn't reveal your position.
-   Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight.

#### Sentinel
Mostly for the last item - additional sneak attacks which are once per **turn** and the reaction will not be on your turn.

You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits.

-   When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
-   Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
-   When a creature makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.

#### Mobile
You are exceptionally speedy and agile. You gain the following benefits:

-   Your speed increases by 10 feet.
-   When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.
-   When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.
