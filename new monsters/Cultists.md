Cultists are all about drawing as much blood as possible (doing damage) and then going down fast in an extravagantly gory fashion.

### Powers
- [rage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#Rage-51)
	- advantage str checks and saves
	- dam bonus to str based attacks
	- resistance to B,P & S damage (doesn't really fit so prob won't use this one)
	- for the barbarian this ends if you don't attack or take dsamage
	- but I can see cultists continue it by attacking nearby allies 
- [reckless attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#RecklessAttack-53)
	- advantage to attack rolls
	- advantage on attacks against you
	- very fitting for Khorne
- for colour maybe they wound themselves drawing blood to get the powers from Khorne
- turn red, stretch their skins, sprout tusks or horns as they grow to large size and do extra damage
	- if killed whilst grown they explode in a fountain of blood requiring anyone within 10 ft to use a bonus action to wipe their eyes or attack with disadvantage
- weapons burst into demonic flame for fire damage
- always use weapons that draw blood
- priests can induce the rage of khorne in others i.e. pcs
	- charisma save
	- gives reckless attack
	- once enemies dead requires cha save to not continue and attack nearest creature
	- I like this being a cha save.  Whilst it is actually appropriate, it's a less used stat and often a dump stat
