Cultists are all about drawing as much blood as possible (doing damage) and then going down fast in an extravagantly gory fashion.

### Priests

Maybe have several templates, is that different functions?  Maybe a bit like the different roles in X-Com.

- support
- offense
- mobility

### Powers
- [rage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#Rage-51)
	- advantage str checks and saves
	- dam bonus to str based attacks (+2)
	- resistance to B,P & S damage (doesn't really fit so prob won't use this one)
	- for the barbarian this ends if you don't attack or take damage
	- but I can see cultists continue it by attacking nearby allies 
- [reckless attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#RecklessAttack-53)
	- advantage to attack rolls
	- advantage on attacks against you
	- very fitting for Khorne
- for colour maybe they wound themselves drawing blood to get the powers from Khorne
- turn red, stretch their skins, sprout tusks or horns as they grow to large size and do extra damage
	- if killed whilst grown they explode in a fountain of blood requiring anyone within 10 ft to use a bonus action to wipe their eyes or attack with disadvantage
- weapons burst into demonic flame for fire damage
- dust of [[dazed]] for a reaction on being attacked
- always use weapons that draw blood
- priest power ideas
	- [[Arcane Blast]]
- priests can induce the rage of khorne in others i.e. pcs
	- charisma save
	- gives reckless attack
	- once enemies dead requires cha save to not continue and attack nearest creature
	- I like this being a cha save.  Whilst it is actually appropriate, it's a less used stat and often a dump stat
- spirit of Khorne
	- passes between npcs when they die (like agent Smith)
	- gives significant advantages
		- multi attack - yes
		- risposte - probably not
		- weapon bursts into demonic flames + 1d6 fire
	- has an aoe aggro effect
		- 15ft radius
		- start of your turn charisma save DC 15
		- must attack possessed npc on fail with lethal damage
		- use move action to close
		- and not move away
		- on save disadvantage on attacks agst others
		- but can move out of radius
