AC: 17
Hit Points: 4d4 (10)
Move: 90 ft flying

---
Resistances

Resistance to piercing damage (maybe slashing too?)
Advantage on Dex saves and checks

Sharpness: on a critical hit the Tensor beast does an extra 2d6 damage.

Hard to shoot: ranged attack rolls have disadvantage against the Tensor beast

Flyby: The Tensor Beast doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach. Like a [5e Owl](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16974-owl)

Speedy target: you must make a DC 15 Dex check to react fast enough to make an attack of opportunity against a Tensor Beast

Actions

> [!QUESTION]- Does AC need to be higher?
> Should it be 18?
> But having said that, they will be quite hard to engage in combat.

> [!QUESTION]- More Hit points?
> Are they too squishy at 4d4 (average 10)?
> Maybe 5d4?

> [!QUESTION]- More movement?
> I was initially thinking 120ft but Owls only have 60ft?
