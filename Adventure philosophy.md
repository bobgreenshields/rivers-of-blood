- Have a main plot... *(e.g. cultists seeking to summon a demon of Orcus)*
- Have small quests start from there
	- Keep them close
	- Go back to the same town
	- Some will be in the town
- Side quests provide
	- clues to the main quest
		- access to people who know things
		- letters
		- maps
		- legends
		- the location of places of interest
	- items geared to help with the main quest
	- loot
- Use Nentir Vale as the setting
	- Available maps
	- Interesting geography
- Maybe use some of the 4e encounters from Keep on the Shadowfell
	- The module is in the Rivers of Blood assets folder
- Use a node based scenario design
	- see [Node based design](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7985/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-3-inverting-the-three-clue-rule)
	- multiple entry nodes
	- clues at each node point to several other nodes

> I was going to go with the D&D  pantheon for this, only because it is already fully documented, but am very happy to go  with any others

> [!FAQ]- Chaos Gods
> Depending on how you feel about it I would quite like to inject the Chaos Gods from Warhammer 40K into this setting (they are also the same gods in plain old Warhammer)
