- Is it salt or maybe [[Pelucid]]?

By the side of the road lies the remains of a wagon train.  A half a dozen corpses surround two wagons, one shattered, one overturned.

Run a perception check and the pcs will find a strange white powder on the ground next to one of the wagons.  It's salt.  Following the trail (Investigation) leads the pcs to discover hidden compartments under the overturned wagon.  These hold two small barrels of salt, worth several hundred GP.

Salt (worth more than its weight in gold) can only be brought into Fallcrest by the Lord Warden who controls the supply and charges a high price for it.

The salt is being smuggled by [[The Cudgel]] into [[Fallcrest]] to be sold out.

If the pcs try and sell the salt in [[Fallcrest]] all of the likely buyers will know that it belonged to [[The Cudgel]] and will immediately say that they have no interest in having anything to do with it and will send the party away.

Word will quickly reach [[The Cudgel]] who will make a visit on the party (along with his heavies) accusing them of not only stealing his salt but insulting him by trying to sell his salt in his own back yard.

If the party do not give him the salt the heavies will attack.  The party at low level will be no match for the heavies who will wound the party but hold short of killing them.

Whether they give [[The Cudgel]] his salt willingly or not he will demand payment for the insult by way of sabotaging [[Calthar]]'s alchemy operation in [[Pure Alchemy]].
