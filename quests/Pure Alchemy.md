[[The Cudgel]]'s main rival [[Calthar]] has blackmailed an alchemist to brew [[Potion of Heroism]] for him.

[[Calthar]] has pre-sold his first batch around [[Fallcrest]] and production is beginning.

[[The Cudgel]] wants to sabotage the production to damage [[Calthar]]'s reputation and finances.

The potions are being brewed in a rickety four storey house guarded by the [[Cuthroats]] both outside and in.  The location is a closely guarded secret but [[The Cudgel]] has a mole in the [[Cuthroats]] who has given him the information.   [[The Cudgel]] does not want the action to be traced back to him and so cannot use any of his own personnel.

What [[The Cudgel]] does not know is that the reagents are not only highly volatile and flammable but when breathed in can create a feeling of euphoric invulnerability.  It will be all to easy for the distillery to go up in a huge ball of flame taking the entire house down with it.

If the party watch the house they will note that the [[Cuthroats]] guards that go into the house each carry a small cloth sack.  They contain a long beaked plague mask to protect them from the fumes.

Unbeknownst to [[Calthar]] the alchemist is member of the chaos cult.  He has a secret shrine and letters that incriminate other members of the cult.

The challenge for the pcs will be
- to disable the production
- without destroying the entire house
- setting fire to the town
- come away with a few [[Potion of Heroism]]
- discover that the alchemist is a cultist
- get evidence of other cultists

If the party does significant damage to the town [[The Cudgel]] will suggest that the party finds a good reason to leave town for a while to let things cool down.  A publicly know quest would be a good idea.
