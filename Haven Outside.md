Hadley’s Haven

Map Note: 1 square roughly equals 10m

The entire area uneven, with rises and hollows.  The woods are deciduous, with patchy undergrowth. Visibility varies between 30 and 90 feet.

There are several large rock outcroppings, each from 5-15 feet high.  They are easy to climb, if desired. 

At dawn and dusk many Cultists are moving around the camp, either moving out (dawn) or returning (dusk).
During the day 50% of the cultists will be away from the settlement, foraging and hunting.
In the evening a large number of the cultists congregate in the main hall for ceremonies.
At night almost all cultists are in their accommodation.

Dock
A ‘U’ shape of thick planks.  Up the side of the pillar of the arch is a switchback 5’ wide staircase, made from timber but with regular reinforcing stone beams sunk into holes in the rock.

At the SE corner is a wider platform.  It is the base area for a counterweighted winch and pulley system which lowers a 4f2 platform from the plateau above.  It can hold 50kg safely. 

T – Towers
A 15-foot wooden frame supports a small platform with log walls, waist high, reached by a rope ladder.  
 
There is always a cultist in each tower, who rings the bell if anyone approaches along the trail.
They are armed with arbalests (-2 to hit, 2d6 damage).  There are 10 bolts (if you need more than that you’re probably dead…)

PS- Pulley Station
A large, well-constructed timber frame supporting the counterweighted dumb waiter from the dock below

H – Habitats
Simple huts with two rooms; a bed area and a cooking area.  Each accommodates 1-2 adult and 0-2 children.  Each may have one of the huge spears lying outside, along the foot of one of the walls. 

2H and 3H – Double/Triple Habitats
A larger hut with two or three two-room living quarters.

S - Stores
Hold flour and grain in sacks, dried funghi in crates, lantern oil, animal fat, wool, cured or curing animal hides and suchlike.

D – Derelicts
Empty habitats.  They have furniture.


Summoning Hollow
The entire floor has been cleared and levelled; roughly in the W section, more carefully in the E, and very well in and around the circle and shrine.
W end has light trees and undergrowth on the slope down.  E end slopes have been excavated so the sides are rough but almost sheer.

2 GUARDS are at the lip of the hollow, on the trail at the SW end, from where a set of rough steps lead down the slope.  They are more alert than the majority of those in the camp, as the hollow is off-limits to other than the Priests except during major ceremonies.

The entire E section of the dip is Hallowed (cultists +1 attack, saves, AC; non cultists -1, negated by carrying a Priest’s symbol)
