First stab at a structure for the nodes.

### Motivation
- Rescue [[Malachi Klendathu]]
	- recently disappeared
	- he was a scholar
	- he had a recent visit from a friend (Rarim Chuv) at the [[Warmheart Waystation | waystation]]
	- had something interesting for the mentor (some warp stone)
- Silversmith asks them to retreive a family heirloom with the [[Cudgel's Salt | salt wagon]]
	- it's late
	- and it's coming from the [[Warmheart Waystation | waystation]]
	- it's not an heirloom at all , it's the [[Crimson Tide]]
- Reward and ownership of loot for clearing out the manticore
	- should appeal to Bryn
	- a note from Bergen Biltom to find his son who was searching for the beast
- The Bishop (prompted by the [[Deacon Dasqusti | Deacon]]) sends them on a mission to [[Warmheart Waystation]]
	- hoping they will be their when the [[Waystation assault | hobgoblins attack]]

- Rescue kidnapped sacrificial victims
- Returning with the [[Cudgel's Salt | salt wagon]]
	- they are stopped at the gate
	- the salt is found (if it's still hidden)
	- smuggling salt is a serious crime
	- they get hauled off to meet the Sheriff
	- who scares them a bit
	- but asks for help in identifying those attempting to overthrow the Lord Warden
- Shut down chaos cult
	- should appeal to Bryn (Oath of the Crown Paladin)
- Need some Tiefling link
	- maybe homeless Tiefling are being kidnapped
